# AnantTube Membership

I am Creating a Video Membership app using Python, FastAPI, Celery, FLower, RabbitMQ, Docker & NoSQL. In this project, I explore building a membership application using FastAPI and a managed Cassandra database called [AstraDB](https://dtsx.io).

This project showcases my skills using the tools mentioned above to create solutions that is well tested with high performance. I used a TDD (Test Driven Development) approaches during development. The codebase is dry, clean, readable, maintainable and scalable. The source code could be deployed for production using AWS Lambda using docker

In this project, I implement a number of key features in building a video membership site including:

- Creating Users (with custom fields)
- Saving Secure, Hashed, Passwords
- Authentication
- Video Analytics & Resumable Videos
- Search Engine
- And much more
